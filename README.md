## Project Overview

This project demonstrates practical application of **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** techniques to identify, analyze, and visualize cybersecurity threats specific to the aviation industry. The dashboard provides real-time threat intelligence monitoring with a focus on airlines, airports, and aviation systems.

### Objectives

- Identify and track cybersecurity threats relevant to the aviation sector
- Map threats to the MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Provide actionable intelligence for security operations teams
- Demonstrate OSINT methodology and analysis capabilities
- Create a professional visualization of threat landscape

## OSINT Methodology

### Intelligence Gathering Process

1. **Source Identification**
   - CVE databases (NIST NVD)
   - Aviation-specific security bulletins (CISA Aviation)
   - Threat intelligence platforms (VirusTotal, Shodan)
   - Security research publications
   - Industry advisories and vendor disclosures

2. **Data Collection**
   - Monitoring public vulnerability databases
   - Tracking aviation-related security incidents
   - Analyzing threat actor TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures)
   - Reviewing security forums and disclosure platforms

3. **Analysis & Correlation**
   - Mapping threats to MITRE ATT&CK framework
   - Assessing relevance to aviation operations
   - Identifying attack patterns and trends
   - Correlating incidents across multiple sources

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - Prioritization based on severity and impact
   - Classification by threat type and target system
   - Impact evaluation on airline operations

5. **Documentation & Reporting**
   - Structured threat intelligence reports
   - Actionable recommendations
   - Visual data representation

---

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3** - Modern web standards for structure and styling
- **JavaScript** - Interactive elements and dynamic content
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-friendly interface
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** - Threat classification and mapping
- **GitHub Pages** - Free hosting and deployment

---

## Key Threat Categories Monitored

### Critical Systems
- **ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast)** - Aircraft tracking vulnerabilities
- **ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System)** - Unencrypted communications
- **Flight Management Systems (FMS)** - Navigation and autopilot vulnerabilities
- **Reservation & Booking Systems** - Customer data and operational disruption
- **Airport Infrastructure** - Ground systems and network security

### Threat Types
- Ransomware campaigns targeting airlines
- Supply chain compromises
- Phishing and social engineering
- Network protocol vulnerabilities
- Physical security bypasses

---

## OSINT Sources Referenced

- [NIST National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/)
- [CISA Aviation Cybersecurity](https://www.cisa.gov/aviation)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org/)
- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)
- [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/)

## Key Findings & Recommendations

### Major Vulnerabilities Identified
1. **Unencrypted ACARS Communications** - Legacy systems transmit sensitive flight data in plaintext
2. **ADS-B Spoofing Risk** - Lack of authentication in aircraft tracking systems
3. **Supply Chain Attacks** - Third-party aviation software vendors as attack vectors
4. **Credential Stuffing** - Loyalty programs and booking systems targeted

### Security Recommendations
- Implement Zero Trust architecture for operational systems
- Migrate to encrypted communication protocols (FANS 1/A+)
- Conduct regular supply chain security audits
- Enhanced security awareness training for aviation personnel

---

## Skills Demonstrated
